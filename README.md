# BART-representation
A Python script to calculate what percent of daily riders live in each BART district. I make the assumption that we can conflate a rider's entry point into the BART system with where they live.

### Preliminary results

* 10.19% of riders aren't represented on the BART Board
* 5.30% of riders are in District 1
* 2.04% of riders are in District 2
* 9.53% of riders are in District 3
* 13.43% of riders are in District 4
* 4.53% of riders are in District 5
* 3.97% of riders are in District 6
* 15.68% of riders are in District 7
* 9.78% of riders are in District 8
* 25.52% of riders are in District 9
