# BART-representation
A Python script to calculate what percent of 2018 daily riders live in each BART district. I make the assumption that we can conflate a rider's entry point into the BART system with where they live.

### Preliminary results

* 10.19% of riders aren't represented on the BART Board
* 5.30% of riders are in District 1
* 2.04% of riders are in District 2
* 9.53% of riders are in District 3
* 13.43% of riders are in District 4
* 4.53% of riders are in District 5
* 3.97% of riders are in District 6
* 15.68% of riders are in District 7
* 9.78% of riders are in District 8
* 25.52% of riders are in District 9

These preliminary results validate my hypothesis that riders in districts 4, 7, and 9 are underrepresented on the BART Board as there are significantly more of them for each of their representatives. These are some of the most urban BART districts including parts of Oakland and San Francisco.

It's notable that several BART stations on the peninsula aren't represented by any BART Board Director at all, these include several of the BART stations on the peninsula that have about 10% of ridership.
